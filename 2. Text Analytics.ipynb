       " 'bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn t bother lining the skirt portion  grrrrrrrrrrr    my stats are 34a 28 29 36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half  so i would say it s running big   the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too   i m 5 6  and it came to just below my knees ',\n",
       " 'this is a nice choice for holiday gatherings  i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings  the size small fit me well   i am usually a size 2 4 with a small bust  in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up  but then perhaps the waist will be too big   the problem with this dress is the quality  the fabrics are terrible  the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip',\n",
       " 'i took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly  but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn t  these are for an hour glass figure  i am more straight up and down  the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up  i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips   for me  that said  they are really nice  sturdy  linen like fabric  pretty color  well made  i hope they make someone very happy ',\n",

       " 'if this product was in petite  i would get the petite  the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that      fits nicely  i m 5 4  130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into      the tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting ',\n",

       " 'first of all  this is not pullover styling  there is a side zipper  i wouldn t have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me   second of all  the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath   not at all what is looks like or is described as  sadly will be returning  but i m sure i will find something to exchange it for ',\n",
       " 'cute little dress fits tts  it is a little high waisted  good length for my 5 9 height  i like the dress  i m just not in love with it  i dont think it looks or feels cheap  it appears just as pictured ',\n",
       " 'i love this shirt because when i first saw it  i wasn t sure if it was a shirt or dress  since it is see through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings  i bought a slip  wore the tie in the back  and rocked it with white wedges  you could also wear it as a vest  be careful with the buttons  i haven t had any fall off yet  but i feel like they will  overall it s great for any occasion and it s fun to wear ',\n",
       " 'loved the material  but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium  im 5 5  and there was atleast 5  of material at my feet  the gaps in the front are much wider than they look  felt like the dress just fell flat  both were returned  im usually a large and the med fit better  36d 30 in jeans',\n",
       " 'i have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive  this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat  the sleeves are very wide  although long   as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don t need to be as wide because you wouldn t be layerng too much underneath  the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit  i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh',\n",
       " 'the colors weren t what i expected either  the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldn t find anything to really go with it  fabric is thick and good quality  has nice weight and movement to it  the skirt just wasn t for me  in the end ',\n",
       " 'i have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them  especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated  don t hesitate  buy this shirt  you won t be sorry     ',\n",
       " 'this sweater is so comfy and classic   it balances a quirky hand knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit  it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style  and as others mentioned  there are gaps in the knit that make it see through  in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering  i like having a longer camisole showing underneath  or wearing it over a little dress  it s warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat ',\n",

       " 'i never would have given these pants a second look online  in person they are much cuter  the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering  the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend  this brand has always run small for me  i am 5 8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly  i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer',\n",
       " 'these pants are even better in person  the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned ',\n",
       " 'i ordered this 3 months ago  and it finally came off back order  a huge disappointment  the fit wasn  39 t so much the issue for me  the quality of the wool is subpar  someone else mentioned a  quot felted wool quot    i guess  is that what you call it   it does literally feel like felt  super thin  itchy  doesn  39 t drape very well  and feels cheap  made in china   i got it on sale  but still not worth what i paid  definitely going back ',\n",
       " 'this is such a neat dress  the color is great and the fabric is super soft  i am tall so the long length was an added bonus  it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps  i am going to pair it with a funky tank top  necklaces and boots  super cute  ',\n",

       " 'tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it  it is so comfortable and flattering  it s too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can t see the ruching across the front  a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer  5 8   and i generally wear a 6  the small fit well  will probably be back for the black ',\n",

       " 'great fit even for busty women  ordered an 8 because i usually need the room in the chest area on dresses  36d dd  fit nicely without being tight  might have been able to size down but i didn t want to risk being too tight  flattering especially on curves  nice for contemporary office or special occasion  if you like his designs  you won t be disappointed ',\n",
       " 'love this top  purchased it in the coral color now i m definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such a great blouse for transitioning into fall  the weight of the top it good since i live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather  i m sure when the time comes adding a long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great  fit true to size ',\n",
       " 'absolutely love this suit  the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to  it does not ride up at all  which almost never happens with swim suits  i m going to order this in a different color next season  i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments ',\n",
       " 'i just love this dress   took me ordering a number of sizes  petite and regular to find the best fit   i might still have the top altered   i received a lot of compliements   work it with some black leather wedges for daytime work ',\n",
       " 'i got the purple color and absolutely love it  i am 5 2  but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer  i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm  it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely ',\n",
       " 'love the color  very soft  unique look  can t wait to wear it this fall',\n",
       " 'i got the rooster version and the colors are simply gorgeous   i m not so much into wearing a farm animal image  but the colors are just too striking to pass this up  the sweater is tts  but with a slightly baggy fit  i did not find it scratchy ',\n",
